## ðŸ§˜ Purpose

As developers, we often get deeply absorbed in our work and lose track of time, leading to fatigue, poor sleep, or even burnout.  
This tool helps raise awareness of your daily cycle by:

- Logging when you got up, started/ended work, took breaks, or went to bed
- Reminding you to take breaks every 3 hours during active work periods
- Encouraging healthier routines for sustainable productivity

  - Waking up
  - Starting/ending work
  - Starting/ending breaks

- Automatic break reminder when `work begin` is active
