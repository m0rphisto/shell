Due to the fact that I was student in a course at CloudCommand GmbH in order to get some specific certificates, I had very little amount of time for my private projects. I had a few things to do: learning; hacking at the ccLabs, HackTheBox, TryHackMe, etc.; do homeworks; getting a proper work/life balance and so on. Surely that was a bit time consuming. :-)

The certificates are:
- IT-Fachkraft f√ºr Systemadministration und Cybersecurity
- IT-Sicherheitsbeauftragter gem. ISO 27001
- BSI IT-Grundschutzpraktiker
- Datenschutzbeauftragter IHK


The course is AZAV certified and was really good!
